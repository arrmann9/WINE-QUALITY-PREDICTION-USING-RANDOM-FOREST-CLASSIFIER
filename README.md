# WINE-QUALITY-PREDICTION-USING-RANDOM-FOREST-CLASSIFIER
This project implements a Wine Quality Prediction Model using the Random Forest Classifier. The model is trained on a red wine dataset to classify wine as either good quality (â‰¥7) or bad quality (&lt;7) based on its physicochemical properties.
